    >Supply orders and deliveries are simple Acts that focus on the delivered product. The product is associated with the Supply Act via Participation.type_cd="product". With general Supply Acts, the precise identification of the Material (manufacturer, serial numbers, etc.) is important.  Most of the detailed information about the Supply should be represented using the Material class.  If delivery needs to be scheduled, tracked, and billed separately, one can associate a Transportation Act with the Supply Act.  Pharmacy dispense services are represented as Supply Acts, associated with a Substance_administration  Act. The Substance_administration class represents the administration of medication, while dispensing is supply.</rdfs:comment>

    >An address part is essentially a character string that may have a type-tag signifying itï¿½s role in the address.  Typical parts that exist in about every address are street, house number, or post box, ZIP code, city, country but other roles may be defined regionally, nationally, or on an enterprise level (e.g. in military addresses).  Addresses are usually broken up into lines, which is indicated by special line-break tokens.
Addresses are conceptualized as text with added mark-up.  The mark-up breaks the address into lines and describes the role of each address part if it is known.  Address parts occur in the address in the order in which they would be printed on a mailing label.  The model is similar to HTML or XML markup of text.</rdfs:comment>

    >ISO Object Identifier: A globally unique string representing an ISO Object Identifier (OID) in a form that consists only of numbers and dots (e.g., "2.16.840.1.113883.3.1"). According to ISO, OIDs are paths in a tree structure, with the left-most number representing the root and the right-most number representing a leaf.
 Each branch under the root corresponds to an assigning authority. Each of these assigning authorities may, in turn, designate its own set of assigning authorities that work under its auspices, and so on down the line. Eventually, one of these authorities assigns a unique (to it as an assigning authority) number that corresponds to a leaf node on the tree. The leaf may represent an assigning authority (in which case the root OID identifies the authority), or an instance of an object. An assigning authority owns a namespace, consisting of its sub-tree.
OIDs are the preferred scheme for unique identifiers. OIDs should always be used except if one of the inclusion criteria for other schemes apply.</rdfs:comment>

    >A categorization of competency of the Entity that plays the Role as defined by the Entity that scopes the Role.
An Entity, in a particular Role, can participate in an Act. Note that a particular entity in a particular role can participate in an act in many ways. Thus, a Person in the role of a practitioner can participate in a patient encounter as a rounding physician or as an attending physician. The Role defines the competency of the Entity irrespective of any Act, as opposed to Participation, which is limited to the scope of an Act.
Each role is 'played' by one Entity (the Entity that is in the role) and is usually 'scoped' by another. Thus the Role of 'patient' is played by (usually) a person and scoped by the provider from whom the patient will receive services. Similarly, the employer scopes an Employee role.
The identifier of the Role identifies the Entity playing the role. This identifier is formally either issued by the scoping Entity or, at least, formally recognized by the scoping Entity as an identifier of the Role.
Attributes of Role are those that are particular to the playing entity while in the particular role.
Rationale: Requires further constraint: invariant (Role x) where x.nonNull  x.played_by.nonNull.or(x.scoped_by.nonNull);</rdfs:comment>

For example, if SNOMED RT defines a concept "leg", a role relation "has-laterality", and another concept "left", the concept role relation allows to add the modifier "has-laterality: left" to a primary code "leg" to construct the meaning "left leg".
The use of modifiers is strictly governed by the code system used.  The CD does not permit using code modifiers with code systems that do not provide for modifiers (e.g. pre-coordinated systems, such as LOINC, ICD-10 PCS.)  The rules of the modifier use must be governed by the code system (e.g., recent SNOMED RT revision, GALEN.)</rdfs:comment>

    >A ratio quantity is a quantity constructed through division of a numerator quantity with a denominator quantity.  Ratios are different from rational numbers, i.e., in ratios common factors in the numerator and denominator never cancel out.  A ratio of two real or integer numbers is not automatically reduced to a real number.
The purpose of the ratio data type is to support certain quantities produced by laboratories, such as titers (e.g., "1:128").  Ratios are not simply "structured numerics", blood pressure measurements (e.g. "120/60") are not ratios.</rdfs:comment>

A sponsor is the party that is ultimately accountable for the coverage by employment contract or by law. A sponsor can be an employer, union, government agency, or association. Fully insured sponsors establish the terms of the plan and contract with health insurance plans to assume the risk and to administer the plan. Self-insured sponsors delegate coverage administration, but not risk, to third-party administrators. Program sponsors designate services to be covered in accordance with statute. Program sponsors may administer the coverage themselves, delegate coverage administration, but not risk to third-party administrators, or contract with health insurance plans to assume the risk and administrator a program. Sponsors qualify individuals who may become
   1.   a policy holder of the plan;
   2.   where the sponsor is the policy holder, who may become a subscriber or a dependent to a policy under the plan; or
   3.     where the sponsor is a government agency, who may become program eligibles under a program.
The sponsor role may be further qualified by the SponsorRole.code. Entities playing the sponsor role may also play the role of a Coverage Administrator.

    >A telecommunication address is a locator for some resource (information or services) mediated by telecommunication equipment. The semantics of a telecommunication address is that a communication entity responds to that address (the responder.) and therefore can be contacted by a communication initiator.
The responder of a telecommunication address may be an automatic service that can respond with information (e.g., FTP or HTTP services.) In such case a telecommunication address is a reference to that information accessible through that address. A telecommunication address value can thus be resolved to some information (in the form of encoded data, ED.)
A given telecommunication address value may have limited validity through time and may be tagged by a use code to indicate under what circumstances a specific telecommunication address may be preferred among a set of alternatives.
The telecommunication address is an extension of the Universal Resource Locator (URL) that specifies as an Internet standard RFC 1738 [http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1738.txt]. The URL specifies the protocol and the contact point defined by that protocol for the resource. Notable uses of the telecommunication address data type are for telephone and telefax numbers, e-mail addresses, Hypertext references, FTP references, etc.</rdfs:comment>

    >A monetary amount is a quantity expressing the amount of money in some currency. Currencies are the units in which monetary amounts are denominated in different economic regions. While the monetary amount is a single kind of quantity (money) the exchange rates between the different units are variable. This is the principle difference between physical quantity and monetary amounts, and the reason why currency units are not physical units.
Equality of two monetary amounts -- unlike physical quantities -- is determined as the joint equality of their value and currency properties independently.  If the currencies are not equal, the amounts cannot be compared. Conversion between the currencies is outside the scope of this specification. In practice, foreign exchange rates are highly variable not only over long and short amounts of time, but also depending on location and access to currency trade markets.</rdfs:comment>

    >A physical quantity is a dimensioned quantity expressing the result of a measurement act and are represented as pairs of value and unit.  However, semantically, a physical quantity is more than a pair of value and unit.  To find out whether two physical quantities are equal, it is not enough to compare equality of their two values and units independently.  For example, semantically 100 cm equals 1 m although neither values nor units are equal.  To define equality we introduce the notion of a canonical form.
Every physical quantity has a canonical form.  The canonical form is a physical quantity expressed as a pair of value and unit such that each dimension in a given unit system has one and only one canonical value-unit pair.  Defining the canonical form is not subject of this specification, only asserting that such a canonical form exists for every physical quantity.  A physical quantity is equal to its canonical form.
For example, for a unit system based on the Systï¿½me International (SI) one can define the canonical form as (a) the product of only the base units; (b) without prefixes; where (c) only multiplication and exponents are used (no division operation); and (d) where the seven base units appear in a defined ordering (e.g., m, s, g, ...)  Thus, 1 mm Hg would be expressed as 133322 m-1.s-2.g.  As can be seen, the rules how to build the canonical form of units may be quite complex.  However, for the semantic specification it doesnï¿½t matter how the canonical form is built, nor what specific canonical form is chosen, only that some canonical form could be defined.
Two physical quantities are equal if each their values and their units of their canonical forms are equal.
Two physical quantities compare each other (and have an ordering and difference) if the units of their canonical forms are equal.</rdfs:comment>

    >Unique identifier String (UID): A unique identifier string is a character string which identifies an object in a globally unique and timeless manner. The allowable formats and values and procedures of this data type are strictly controlled by HL7. At this time, user-assigned identifiers may be certain character representations of ISO Object Identifiers (OID) and DCE Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID). HL7 also reserves the right to assign other forms of UIDs (RUID), such as mnemonic identifiers for code systems.
The sole purpose of UID is to be a globally and timelessly unique identifier. The form of UID, whether it is an OID, a UUID or a RUID, is entirely irrelevant. As far as HL7 is concerned, the only thing one can do with a UID is denote to the object for which it stands. Comparison of UIDs is literal, i.e. if two UIDs are literally identical, they are assumed to denote to the same object. If two UIDs are not literally identical they may not denote to the same object.</rdfs:comment>

A party other than the author may only amend, reverse, override, replace, or follow up in other ways on this Act, whereby the Act remains intact and is linked to another Act authored by that other party.</rdfs:comment>

    >UncertainValueProbabilistic . This is a generic data type extension to specify one uncertain value tagged with a probability.  The probability expresses the information producerï¿½s belief that the given value holds.  How the probability number was arrived at is outside the scope of this specification.

Probabilities are subjective and (as any pieces of data) apply in a context.  The context of any data item is the data structure in which that item appears.  While the context dependence is important for any information, it is critical to understand the context dependency of probabilities: when new information is found the probability might change.  Thus, for any message (document, or other information representation) the information -- and particularly the probabilities -- reflects what the information producer believed was appropriate at the given time and for the given purpose for which the message (document) was created.

Since probabilities are subjective measures of belief, they can be stated without being "correct" or "incorrect" per se, let alone "precise" or "imprecise".  Notably, one does not have to entertain experiments to measure a frequency of some outcome in order to specify a probability.  In fact, whenever statements about individual people or events are made, it is not possible to confirm such probabilities with "frequentists" experiments.

The type T is not formally constrained.  In theory, discrete probabilities can only be stated for discrete data values.  Thus, generally UVP&lt;REAL> and UVP&lt;PQ> values should not be stated.  However, by definition a discrete value set is one that is finite or countably infinite, and abiding by this definition any measured value or real number recorded with digits is discrete. Thus, the distinction between discrete and continuous values is not practical for our purpose.  Indeed, even though integer numbers are discrete (countably infinite) estimating a single integer number and tagging it with a probability is not reasonable.  Most textbook on statistics treat estimations of integers or ordinals as real numbers when defining the estimated value of a random sample X as the sum of x * p(x) over all x in X.</rdfs:comment>

    >A public health case is an Observation representing a condition or event that has a specific significance for public health. Typically it involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. An outbreak involving multiple individuals may be considered as a type of public health case. A public health case definition (Act.mood_cd = "definition") includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.

A set is a value that contains other values of a certain data type as its elements.  The elements are contained in no particular ordering.  All elements in the set are distinct, the same element value cannot be contained more than once in the set.

The primitive semantic property of a set is the contains-relation of elements in the set.  On this semantic primitive, all other properties are defined.  A set may only contain distinct non-NULL elements.  Exceptional values (NULL-values) cannot be elements of a set.

The empty set is a set without any elements.  The empty set is a proper set value, not an exceptional (NULL) value.  The cardinality of a set is the number of distinct elements in the set.

The cardinality definition is not sufficient since it doesnï¿½t converge for uncountably infinite sets (REAL, PQ, etc.) and it doesnï¿½t terminate for infinite sets.  In addition, the definition of integer number type in this specification is incomplete for these cases, as it doesnï¿½t account for infinities.  Finally the cardinality value is an example where it would be necessary to distinguish the cardinality aleph0 of countably infinite sets (e.g., INT) from aleph1, the cardinality of uncoutable sets (e.g., REAL, PQ).</rdfs:comment>

    >BinaryData. All communicated information must ultimately be physically encoded as binary data.  Binary data is the most primitive yet the omnipotent encoding of all information.
Binary data is a sequence of uninterpreted bits.  A bit is identical with a Boolean value.  Thus, all binary data is semantically a sequence of Boolean values.  The binary data type is protected, it should not be used directly but only inside the encoded data (ED) type described below.
ITS Note: the representation of arbitrary binary data is the responsibility of an ITS.  How the ITS accomplishes this depends on the underlying Implementation Technology (whether it is character-based or binary) and on the so represented data.  Semantically character data is represented as binary data, however, a character-based ITS should not convert character data into arbitrary binary data and then represent binary data in a character encoding.  Ultimately even character-based implementation technology will communicate binary data.
It follows from the definition of the sequence generic type (LIST) that an "empty" sequence of binary data is not a valid value but counts as a NULL-value.  In other words, non-NULL binary data contains at least one bit.</rdfs:comment>

Each contained Observation Sequence LIST&lt;> must be the same length. Values in the LIST&lt;>'s are correlated based on index. E.g. the values in position 2 in all the LIST&lt;>'s are correlated. This is analogous to a table where each column is an Observation Sequence with a LIST&lt;> of values, and each row in the table is a correlation between the columns.

    >Character String, The character string is a restricted encoded data type (ED), whose type property is fixed to text/plain, and whose data must be inlined and not compressed.  Thus, the properties compression, reference, integrity check, algorithm, and thumbnail are not applicable.  The character string data type is used when the appearance of text does not bear meaning, which is true for formalized text and all kinds of names.
The character string (ST) data type interprets the encoded data as character data (as opposed to bits), depending on the charset property of the encoded data type.  
because many of the properties of the encoded data are bound to a default value, an ITS need not represent these properties at all.  In fact, if the character encoding is also fixed, the ITS only represents the encoded character data.
ISO/IEC 10646-1: 1993 defines a character as "A member of a set of elements used for the organization, control, or representation of data."  ISO/IEC TR 15285 " An operational model for characters and glyphs.  Discusses the problems involved in defining characters.  Notably, characters are abstract entities of information, independent of type font or language.  The ISO 10646 (UNICODE  [http://www.unicode.org]) "  or in Japan, JIS X0221 "  is a globally applicable character set that uniquely identifies all characters of any language in the world.
In this specification, ISO 10646 serves as a semantic model for character strings.  The important point is that for semantic purposes, there is no notion of separate character sets and switching between character sets.  Character set and character encoding are ITS layer considerations.  The formal definition gives indication to this effect because each character is by itself an ST value that has a charset property.  Thus, the binary encoding of each character is always understood in the context of a certain character set.  This does not mean that the ITS should represent a character string as a sequence of full blown ED values.  What it means is that on the application layer the notion of character encoding is irrelevant when we deal with character strings.
The length of a string is the number of characters, not the number of encoded bytes.  Byte encoding is an ITS issue and is not relevant on the application layer.</rdfs:comment>

    >Encapsulated Data, The encoded data type can convey any data.  However, in order for that data to convey meaning, encoded data must be decoded and further interpreted.  Encoded data may be a plain character string, formatted text, or any of several kinds of multimedia data.  The kind of encoding is conveyed in three properties:
1. type - specifies the protocol, or application used to decode and interpret the data (also known as the "media type" as referring to multi-media data.)
2. charset - identifies the character set and character encoding for character-based "media."
3. compression - data may be given in a compressed form in which case compression identifies the compression algorithm used.
Encoded data can be present in two forms, inline or by reference. Inline data is communicated or moved as part of the encoded data value, whereas by-reference data may reside at a different (remote) location.  The data is the same whether it is located inline or remote.</rdfs:comment>

Note that data types are specifications of abstract properties of values.  This specification does not mandate how these values are represented in an ITS or implemented in an application.  Specifically, it does not mandate how the represented components are named or positioned.  In addition, the semantic generalization hierarchy may be different from a class hierarchy chosen for implementation (if the implementation technology has inheritance.)  Keep the distinction between a type (interface) and an implementation (concrete data structure, class) in mind.

    >A request or order for a service is an intent directed from a placer (request author) to a fulfiller (service performer).
Rationale: The concepts of a "request" and an "order" are viewed as different, because there is an implication of a mandate associated with order. In practice, however, this distinction has no general functional value in the inter-operation of health care computing. "Orders" are commonly refused for a variety of clinical and business reasons, and the notion of a "request" obligates the recipient (the fulfiller) to respond to the sender (the author). Indeed, in many regions, including Australia and Europe, the common term used is "request."
Thus, the concept embodies both notions, as there is no useful distinction to be made. If a mandate is to be associated with a request, this will be embodied in the "local" business rules applied to the transactions. Should HL7 desire to provide a distinction between these in the future, the individual concepts could be added as specializations of this concept.

The critical distinction here, is the difference between this concept and an "intent", of which it is a specialization. An intent involves decisions by a single party, the author. A request, however, involves decisions by two parties, the author and the fulfiller, with an obligation on the part of the fulfiller to respond to the request indicating that the fulfiller will indeed fulfill the request.</rdfs:comment>

    >An association between a Role and an Act.  The Participation represents the involvement of the Entity playing the Role with regard to the associated Act.  A single Role may participate in multiple Acts and a single Act may have multiple participating Roles.  A single Participation is always an association between a particular Role and a particular Act.
Participation is limited to the scope of the Act, as opposed to Role, which defines the competency of an Entity irrespective of any Act.
Participations are generally grouped into actors and targets.  Examples of actors are nurses, doctors, family members, notary publics, and service organizations -- every person or organization that is capable of independent decisions and can thus be responsible (and liable) for the actions performed. Target participants in an act may include the patient, the patient's spouse, family, or community, a specimen drawn from the patient or from any object of interest.
Actors can participate in an action in different ways. For example, primary surgeon, assistant surgeon, sterile nurse, and nurse assistant are all actors in a surgical procedure, who are more or less immediately involved in the action. However, payers, supervisors, provider organizations (e.g., "MicroLab") and their delegates may be actors too, even though they might not be individual persons who have their "hands on" the action.
The notion of multiple actors with specific functions touches and partially overlaps on two "sides" with related concepts of the RIM, and understanding the distinctions is important to use the RIM constructs correctly. On the one "side" actor functions look similar to Roles (e.g., healthcare practitioner, guarantor, contact-person,) and capability and certification (e.g., certified surgeon vs. resident, certified nurse midwife vs. other midwife practitioner, registered nurse vs. other nurse practitioner.) The professional credentials of a person may be quite different from what a person actually does. The most common example is interns and residents performing anesthesia or surgeries under (more or less) supervision of attending specialists. The opposite example is people who are both medical doctors and registered nurses and who perform the function of a nurse. Thus, Roles and certification refer to the static capabilities of a person (person-related) while participating actors refer to the particular function an actor played in the activity.
On the other "side" the actor concept interferes with sub-activities. Whenever multiple actors are involved in an act, each actor performs a different task (with the extremely rare exception of such symmetrical activities as two people pulling a rope from either end.) Thus, the presence of multiple actors could be equally well modeled as an act consisting of sub-acts where each act would have only one performing actor 
For example, a record of a surgical service may include the actors of type: (a) consenter, (b) primary surgeon, and (c) anesthetist. These three actors really perform different tasks, which can be represented as three related acts: (a) the consent, (b) the surgery proper, and (c) the anesthesia act in parallel to the surgery. If we used the sub-acts, the consenter, surgeon and anesthetist could simply be of actor type "performer." Thus the more sub-acts we use, the fewer different actor types need to be distinguished, and the fewer sub-acts we use, the more distinct actor types we need.
Note that the perception of a task as "atomic" or "composite" (of sub-tasks) depends on local business rules and may differ from department to department. In principle, every task can be thought of as being a composite of sub-tasks. We thus say that actions are "fractal." The paradigmatic example of the fractal nature of activities is a "robotic arm" doing some simple action as reaching for a tool in front of it. The seemingly simple activity of the robotic arm decomposes into complex control and coordination procedures and movements, action of separate motors and switches, etc. (We sometimes use the key-phrase "robotic arm discussion" to recall the fractal nature of actions, since this example has been brought up over and over again, independently by different people.) 
As a rule of thumb, sub-tasks should be considered instead of multiple actors when each sub-task requires special scheduling, or billing, or if overall responsibilities for the sub-tasks are different. In most cases, however, human resources are scheduled by teams (instead of individuals,) billing tends to lump many sub-tasks together into one position, and overall responsibility often rests with one attending physician, chief nurse, or head of department. This model allows both the multi-actor and the muli-act approach to represent the business reality, with a slight bias towards "lumping" minor sub-activities into the overall act.</rdfs:comment>

    >An action of interest that has happened, can happen, is happening, is intended to happen, or is requested/demanded to happen. An act is an intentional action in the business domain of HL7. Healthcare (and any profession or business) is constituted of intentional actions. An Act instance is a record of such an intentional action. 
Any intentional action can exist in different "moods".  Moods describe activities as they progress in the business cycle, from defined, through planned and ordered to complete.
Any instance of an Act assumes one and only one mood and will not change its mood along its life cycle. The moods - definition, intent, order, event - seem to specify a life cycle of an activity. However, the participants in the activity in these different moods are different, as is the data. Therefore, the mood of an Act instance is static. The progression actualization (i.e., the progression from defined, through planned and ordered, to being performed) is called the "business cycle" to distinguish it from the "life cycle" of a single act instance. Related Act instances that form such a "business cycle" are linked through the Act_relationship class.
Examples for acts in health care are: a clinical test, an assessment of health condition (such as problems and diagnoses), the setting of healthcare goals, the performance of treatment services (such as medication, surgery, physical and psychological therapy), assisting, monitoring or attending, training and education services to patients and their next of kin, and notary services (such as advanced directives or living will).
Acts have participants, which can be actors or targets. Examples of actors are nurses, doctors, family members, notary publics, and service organizations -- every person or organization that is capable of independent decisions and can thus is responsible (and liable) for the actions performed.
Target participants in an act may include the patient, the patient's spouse, family, or community, a specimen drawn from the patient or from any object of interest. As patients do play active roles in their own healthcare, the patient can be both an active participant and a target participant at the same time (self-administered or reflexive services.) 
An act can have multiple active participants and multiple target participants, their specific role being distinguished in the "type_cd" of the respective instance of the Participation class. In particular, an act involving coordination of care may involve two or more active participants -- playing different roles -- who interact on behalf of a patient, family, or aggregate in the role of target participant. For example, a nurse (active participant) calls Meals on Wheels (active participant) on behalf of the patient (target participant).
An act includes the "results", "answers" or informational "procedure products" gained during the act. In this model, "results" do not exist without an act, and every clinical result, including those results gained accidentally, is gleaned via an act. In other moods, such as "definition " or "intent", the results are the possible results, the expected or aimed-for results, or the tested-for results.</rdfs:comment>

    >A role played by a device when the device is used to administer therapeutic agents (medication and vital elements) into the body, or to drain material (e.g., exudates, pus, urine, air, blood) out of the body.  For the most part, anything that would be used for access would be a device (something specifically manufactured or created to serve that purpose). Typically the device is a catheter or cannula inserted into a compartment of the body.
A device enters the body from an anatomic site designated by the approach_site_cd. The body compartment into which material is administered or from which it is drained is designated by the target_site_cd.
Note that the Access  role primarily exists in order to describe material actually deployed as an access, and not so much the fresh material as it comes from the manufacturer. For example, in supply ordering a box of catheters from a distributor, it is not necessary to use the Access  role class, since the material attributes will usually suffice to describe and identify the product for the order. But the Access  role is used to communicate about the maintenance, intake/outflow, and due replacement of tubes and drains.
Devices in the role of an Access are typically used in intake/outflow observations, and in medication routing instructions. Microbiologic observations on the material itself or on fluids coming out of a drain, are also common.
OpenIssue: Issue relates to the restriction of access device to persons or animals as patients. In the case where the material desired does not originate from a "living subject" such as in environmental monitoring, then the access device definition needs to reflect that change. For example, an order for a sample to be taken from the clean-out port of a food processing device for a public health investigation.</rdfs:comment>

    >A point in time is a scalar defining a point on the axis of natural time.  A point in time is most often represented as a calendar expression.  Semantically, however, natural time is independent from calendars.  The semantic properties of point in time are best described by its relationship to elapsed time (measured as a physical quantity in the dimension of time.)  A point in time plus an elapsed time yields another point in time.  Inversely, a point in time minus another point in time yields an elapsed time.  As a kind of quantity, points in time are a difference-scale quantity, where no absolute zero-point exists, where only differences are defined but no ratios.  For example, no point in time is -- absolutely speaking -- "twice as late" as another point in time.)
Given some arbitrary zero-point, one can express any point in time as an elapsed time measured from that offset.  Such an arbitrary zero-point is called an epoch.  This epoch-offset form is used as a semantic representation here, without implying that any system would have to implement the TS data type in that way.  Systems that do not need to compute distances between points in time will not need any other representation than a calendar expression literal.</rdfs:comment>

    >DCE Universal Unique Identifier: A globally unique string representing a DCE Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) in the common UUID format that consists of 5 hyphen-separated groups of hexadecimal digits having 8, 4, 4, 4, and 12 places respectively.

Both the UUID and its string representation are defined by the Open Group, CDE 1.1 Remote Procedure Call specification, Appendix A.

UUIDs are assigned based on Ethernet MAC addresses, the point in time of creation and some random component. This mix is believed to generate sufficiently unique identifiers without any organizational policy for identifier assignment (in fact this piggy-backs on the organization of MAC address assignment.)

UUIDs are not the preferred identifier scheme for use as HL7 UIDs. UUIDs may be used when identifiers are issued to objects representing individuals (e.g., entity instance identifiers, act event identifiers, etc.) For objects describing classes of things or events (e.g., catalog items), OIDs are the preferred identifier scheme.</rdfs:comment>

This attribute is primarily used with respect to containment roles.  For example, some containers have discrete positions in which content may be located. Depending on the geometry of the container, the position may be referenced as a scalar ordinal number, or as a vector of ordinal numbers (coordinates.) Coordinates always begin counting at 1. 
Some containers may have customary ways of referring to the positions or no way at all. In absence of any specific regulation for a specific container type, the rule of thumb is that the coordinate that is changed earlier is positioned first. For an automated blood chemistry analyzer with a square shaped tray, this means that the first coordinate is the one in which direction the tray moves at each step and the second coordinate is the one in which the tray moves only every 10 (or so) steps.</rdfs:comment>

    >Specifies the quantity of the given entity, as interpreted in coordination with the determiner_cd. For individual instances of Entities, the qty is 1. For a group of individual members, the qty is the number of individual members in the group. 
When the Entity instance is a portion of a substance, the qty specifies the amount of that substance comprised by that portion. For an undetermined substance (kind) the qty servers two purposes at the same time: (a) it provides a means of relations between quantities specific for that substance, and (b) it is a reference quantity for the specification of ingredients or components.
In all cases, the qty is an extensive "amount" kind of quantity (e.g., number, length, volume, mass, surface are, energy, etc.) Note that most relative or fractional quantities are not amounts, in particular, mass fraction, substance concentration, mass ratios, percentages, etc. are not extensive quantities and are prohibited values for this attribute.
With undetermined kinds, the qty is but a reference quantity for the specification of the proportion of ingredients or components (e.g. through a has-part, has-ingredient, or has-content Role.) For example, a kind of group with 60% females is Person(qty = 100) has-part Person(qty = 60; sex = female). Amoxicillin 500 mg per tablet is Material(Tablet, qty = 1) has-ingredient Material(Amoxicillin, qty = 500 mg). Glucose 50% (D5W) is Material(D5W, qty = 1 kg) has-ingredient Material(Glucose, qty = 50 g).
Material-specific quantity relations are expressed using the fact that the data type of this attribute is a set of physical quantity (SET&lt;PQ>). If more than one qty value are specified in this set, each element in this set is considered to specify the same amount of the material. For example, for one liter of water one could use the set 1 L, 1 kg, 55.56 mol to specify the volume, mass, and amount of substance for the same amount of water, this is equivalent with specifying the mass density (volumic mass 1 kg/L) and the molar mass (18 g/mol). For Glucose one could specify 180 g, 1 mol according to the molar mass (180 g/mol).</rdfs:comment>

For HL7 messaging, the Act.availability_time will be set according to the sender system.
The Act.availability_time is an inert attribute with respect to the mood code. This means, it is the recording time of the act object regardless of its mood.
Rationale: A database that records a separate time stamp for both valid time and transaction time is called a bi-temporal database. Bi-temporal databases allow reconstructing at any time what users of the database actually could have known, versus what the state of the world was at that time. For example, one might record that a patient had a right-ventricular myocardial infarction effective three hours ago, but we may only know about this unusual condition a few minutes ago. Thus, any interventions from three hours ago until a few minutes ago may have assumed a usual left-ventricular infarction, which can explain why these interventions may not have been appropriate in light of the more recent knowledge about the prior state. However, the transaction time (or recording time) may vary from system to system.</rdfs:comment>

    >An association between a pair of Acts.  This includes Act to Act associations such as collector/component, predecessor/successor, and cause/outcome.
The class has two associations to the Act class, one named "source" the other named "target". Consider every Act_relationship instance an arrow with a point (headed to the target) and a butt (coming from the source.) For each relationship type, the functions (or roles) of source and target Act are different. In principle the assignment of functions (roles) to each side of the relationship "arrow" is completely arbitrary. Since the relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the source act object. That means that the originator of the information reported in an act object is not only responsible for the attribute values of that object, but also for all its outgoing relationships.
The rule of attribution is that all act relationships are attributed to the responsible actor of the Act at the source of the Act_relationship (the "source act".)
With this recursive act relationship one can group actions into "batteries," e.g., LYTES, CHEM12, or CBC, where multiple routine laboratory tests are ordered as a group. Some groupings, such as CHEM12, appear more arbitrary; others, such as blood pressure, seem to naturally consist of systolic and diastolic pressure.
Acts may also be grouped longitudinally, in a sequence of sub-actions to form temporal and conditional (non-temporal) action paths (e.g., care plan, critical path, clinical trials, drug treatment protocols).
Acts may be explicitly timed, and may be conditioned on the status or outcome of previous actions. Concurrent collections of acts allow expressing logical branches as well as parallel tasks (tasks carried out at the same time.) These constructs can be organized in multiple layers of nesting, to fully support workflow management.
The Act_relationship class is not only used to construct action plans but also to represent clinical reasoning or judgments about action relationships. Prior actions can be linked as the reasons for more recent actions. Supporting evidence can be linked with current clinical hypotheses. Problem lists and other networks of related judgments about clinical events are represented by the Act_relationship link. 
The Act_relationship.type_cd identifies the meaning and purpose of every Act_relationship instance.</rdfs:comment>

Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a "1st degree burn", the relation "has bounded support" is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general "has support" relation is used.</rdfs:comment>

For example: A role of assignment or agency depends on another role of employment, such that when the employment role is terminated, the assignments would be terminated as well. This is the dependency of the assignment role with the employment role, or in other words, the assignment is "part of" the employment. Another use case is to reflect authority of one role over another (in organizational relationships.) For example, an employee of type "manager" may have authority over employees of type "analyst" which would be indicated by a role link for "direct authority". 
Role_link specifies the relationships between roles, not between people (or other entities.) People (or other Entities) are primarily related by their direct player/scoper relationships around the player's Role and more generally through their interactions (i.e. their participations in acts)</rdfs:comment>

The values for this attribute are drawn from one of several coding systems depending on the class of entities, such as living subjects (typed by animal and plant taxonomies), chemical substance (e.g., IUPAC code), organizations, insurance company, government agency, hospital, park, lake, syringe, etc. Note that Entity.cd may be so fine grained that some types may only have one known instance. Types with an extension of one instance are very similar to names. An example is the CDC vaccine manufacturer code, which is modeled as a concept vocabulary, when in fact each concept refers to only one instance.</rdfs:comment>
